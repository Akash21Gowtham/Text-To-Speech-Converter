To clarify, do you want a Text-To-Speech (TTS) Converter to read content aloud for you? If so, there are several options available:

1.Google Text-to-Speech: Available on Android devices and can read aloud the text on your screen.

2.Microsoft Narrator: A built-in screen reader for Windows that can read aloud the text on your screen.

3.Apple VoiceOver: A built-in screen reader for macOS and iOS devices.

4.Online TTS Services: Websites like NaturalReader, IBM Watson Text to Speech, and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech offer online services where you can paste text, and the website will read it aloud for you.

If you are looking for a specific way to integrate TTS in a project, or if you need a particular platform's instructions, please let me know!
